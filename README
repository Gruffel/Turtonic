# My Personal Portfolio

Please do not look at this code as an example of my work. 
It is in need of refactoring and with having a toddler (1 year and 8months old) while also expecting our second very soon, I have not had the time to clean this up to where it should be.

I just ask for grace on the code for the portfolio website and for you to look more at my professional work as an example of my abilities compaired to this current sites code.

Thank you for understanding.
